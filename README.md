# Shinchan OpenGL Animation

A fun OpenGL animation of Shinchan lying down and giggling, created using C++ and GLUT.  
The animation includes basic transformations like rotation using keyboard controls and playful sound effects (giggling).

This project was created as part of my exploration into OpenGL graphics and animation using Visual Studio.


ðŸŽ¨ Visual elements are drawn using OpenGL primitives.  
ðŸŽµ Audio effect plays when the animation starts (if the sound file is present).  
ðŸŽ® Shinchan can be rotated using the left and right arrow keys.


Made with love and a little nostalgia ðŸ’›
